# NPLEX - NPL Tokenization Platform

## Project Overview

NPLEX is a blockchain-based platform for tokenizing Non-Performing Loan (NPL) packages using the IOTA network. The platform enables retail investors to participate in NPL investments through fractional ownership via the LTC1 (Loan Token Contract) standard.

**Core Philosophy:** Align incentives between Investors (Capital) and Servicers (Labor) through "Skin in the Game".

## Core Concepts

### Business Flow

1. **NPL Acquisition**: A bank creates an NPL package
2. **Tokenization**: The package is tokenized via LTC1 contract
3. **Retail Funding**: Retail investors buy tokens to finance the bank
4. **Revenue Distribution**: As debts are recovered or package is resold, revenue flows back to token holders
5. **Contract Closure**: When package is fully liquidated or resold, contract closes.

### Revenue Sources

The LTC1 contract receives IOTA through **2 channels**:

1. **Debt Recovery**: Servicer recovers debts and deposits recovered amounts
2. **Package Resale**: If the package is sold to another party, sale proceeds are deposited

## Architecture: The 2-Asset Model + DID Gatekeeper

The architecture is built around **two distinct Move Objects** per NPL Package, with ownership tracked via **IOTA DID (Decentralized Identity)**:

1.  **LTC1Package (Shared Object)**: The "State". Holds the pools (funds/revenue), metadata, business logic, and `owner_identity: ID` pointing to the owner's DID document.
2.  **LTC1Token (Owned Object - Many)**: The "Investment". NFTs (`key` only) representing a share of the revenue. Held by investors.

**Ownership** is determined by the `owner_identity` field on LTC1Package, verified at runtime via `DelegationToken` from the IOTA Identity framework. There is no separate "OwnerBond" object.

### Layer 1: NPLEX Registry (Validation + Identity Layer)

- Managed by NPLEX
- Audits and approves NPL package notarizations via IOTA Notarization objects
- Prevents duplicate LTC1 contracts for the same notarization
- Can invalidate contracts (e.g., when all debts recovered)
- Only NPLEX admin can register notarizations after KYC of financial institutions and the creation of the NPL package
- Authorizes ownership transfers and sales toggles, backed by notarization references
- **Manages approved DID identities** with role-based access (Institution, Investor, Admin)

### Layer 2: LTC1 Contracts (Token Layer)

Each LTC1 contract operates using these assets:

#### 1. LTC1 Tokens (For Investors)

- **Role:** Capital contribution & Revenue rights.
- **Properties:** `key` only (no `store`), transferable via `transfer_token` (DID-gated).
- **Acquisition:** Investors mint these by paying into the funding pool.

#### 2. Owner Identity (For Owner — stored on LTC1Package)

- **Role:** Represents **legal ownership** of the NPL package & "Skin in the Game".
- **Mechanism:** The `owner_identity: ID` field on `LTC1Package` points to the owner's approved DID.
- **Verification:** All owner-gated functions verify the caller's `DelegationToken` matches the registered `owner_identity`.
- **Transfer:** Ownership can be transferred to a new DID with NPLEX approval via `transfer_ownership`.

### Layer 3: Fractionalization (Optional)

LTC1Tokens can be fractionalized into fungible DEX-tradeable coins:

- **Fractionalize**: Splits balance from an LTC1Token, mints fungible coins, creates a shared vault
- **Redeem**: Burns coins back into a new LTC1Token with proportional claimed_revenue
- **Merge Back**: Burns coins back into the SAME token (no new token created)
- **Destroy Empty Vault**: Cleanup when vault supply reaches 0

## Workflow

1. **NPLEX Audits**: NPLEX audits NPL package documents and approves notarization
2. **Notarization Registration**: NPLEX registers the approved `Notarization<u256>` object in the Registry
3. **LTC1 Creation**: Creator passes the `Notarization<u256>` object and their `owner_identity: ID` to `create_contract`
4. **Token Sale**: Investors buy tokens directly from LTC1 using `buy_token()`, IOTA goes to funding pool
5. **Funding Withdrawal**: Owner withdraws IOTA from funding pool to finance NPL acquisition (DID-verified)
6. **Recovery**: Owner recovers debt → deposits IOTA into revenue pool (DID-verified)
7. **Claim**: Token holders claim proportional share from revenue pool (DID-verified)
8. **Termination**: NPLEX revokes notarization in Registry (when all credits resolved) → blocks operations except claims

## Revenue Distribution Mechanism (Proportional / Pari-Passu)

Unlike complex **Waterfall Distribution** (or Tranche-based) models where Senior bonds get paid before Junior bonds, LTC1 uses a simple **Proportional Distribution** model. Every token holder is entitled to a share of the revenue exactly equal to their percentage of ownership in the total supply.

**Revenue formula:**

```
entitled = (token.balance × total_revenue_deposited) / total_supply
due = entitled - token.claimed_revenue
```

**Dividend-stripping protection:** When new tokens are bought, `claimed_revenue` is pre-set to prevent "buying into" past revenue. The equivalent amount goes to `owner_legacy_revenue`.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. DID-Based Ownership

Ownership is tracked via the `owner_identity: ID` field on `LTC1Package`, pointing to the owner's **IOTA DID document**. All owner-gated operations verify the caller's `DelegationToken` against this identity.

**Why?** To enforce **Risk Retention** (or "Skin in the Game") without a separate transferable object.
In securitization markets, regulations often require the originator of a security to retain a certain percentage of the risk (e.g. 5%) to ensure their incentives are aligned with investors. If the asset performs poorly, the originator suffers losses alongside the investors.

The `owner_identity` enforces this by binding the unsold supply portion to the owner's DID. Ownership transfer requires NPLEX admin approval via `transfer_ownership`, ensuring the owner remains committed to the asset's performance.

**Token Purchase (Primary Sale):**

- Creator (Bank) creates the package — their DID is set as `owner_identity` on the shared `LTC1Package`.
- Investors call `buy_token()` to purchase shares. The contract **mints new LTC1 Tokens (NFTs)** directly to the investor.
- Creator may transfer ownership to a Servicer via `transfer_ownership` (requires NPLEX approval).
- The `owner_identity` represents the **legal ownership** of the NPL package and the **executive power** to manage it: all unsold shares, the right to claim their revenue, withdraw the funding pool, deposit revenue, and transfer ownership with NPLEX approval.

### 2. Cumulative Claims

Both Investors and Owner claim **all accumulated unclaimed revenue** when calling their claim functions.

### 3. Default Scenario

If the Owner never recovers any debts:

- Revenue pool remains empty
- Tokens remain valid but worthless
- Owner loses their time/effort (Skin in the Game penalty)
- NPLEX may initiate legal action

### 4. Metadata & Documentation

- **Name**: Name of the NPL package
- **Document Hash**: SHA-256 of NPL package ZIP (immutable, stored in Notarization object)
- **Metadata URI**: IPFS/HTTPS link to documents
- **On-chain**: Minimal metadata to save gas (Will change overtime due to compliance which is not yet defined)

## Contract Termination

**Trigger**: NPLEX sets `is_revoked = true` in Registry for the package notarization

**When revoked:**

- **buy_token()**: Blocked - No new token purchases
- **withdraw_funding()**: Blocked - Owner cannot withdraw
- **deposit_revenue()**: Blocked - Owner cannot deposit
- **claim_revenue()**: Allowed - Holders can claim existing revenue forever
- **transfer_token()**: Allowed - Tokens remain tradeable

**Revocation reasons:**

- All debts fully recovered (package liquidated)
- Fraud detected (legal action initiated)

**Post-termination**: Tokens remain as proof of investment, and ownership is still reflected in the `owner_identity` on the package.

## Business Model (Future)

- **No fees** for notarization registration or LTC1 creation in MVP
- Revenue streams (planned):
  - Platform consultation services
  - LTC1 management services
  - Possible transaction fees (TBD when NPLEX must be involved, free otherwise)

## Compliance & Scope (MVP)

- **No jurisdiction/country fields** - compliance deferred to post-MVP
- Focus: Technical proof-of-concept for tokenization

## Future Implementations

### Granular Revocation Control

Currently, revocation is a binary state. Future versions will support granular permissions:

- **Block Deposits Only**: Stop new investments/deposits but allow withdrawals.
- **Block Trading**: Stop token transfers while allowing claims.
- **Full Freeze**: Stop all operations for investigation.
